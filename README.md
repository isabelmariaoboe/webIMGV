 My second project for USN
 
 Name: ​Isabel Maria Guner-Velasco.
 
Project: ​Oblig 2: A simple responsive website.

Content:​ A portfolio, web slider, geolocation and contact information.

Technology used for implementation:​ HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Description:

This is a website designed to be the portfolio with the projects that I have worked and I work with. It is meant to be used in the future as a presentation for future clients.

I started the project planning how many pages would the website need in order to be functional, user-friendly, esthetic and clean. I created four pages: My Portfolio, Work, Contact and About.

My Portfolio contains the web slider with pictures of the general fields I am learning and working with so far. It took me a lot of time and struggle to make it work, following the instructions from our videos and w3schools. I am not fully satisfied with the result because I also wanted to add a transition, but I couldn’t make it work. My Portfolio also contains a short presentation, a review from my last client and a link to the page Contact.

The page Work contains a table with pictures of some projects I worked on and more specific descriptions of what I do.
Contact is the page where I added the geolocation. I couldn’t make it work with JavaScript, so I decided to embed GoogleMaps in order to have it. There is also a link for sending an email for more information or collaboration.

In the page About, you can find a short description about me and my background.

In general, I struggled a lot with JavaScript. It was my first time working with it and I spent a lot of time (days) trying to make it work. On the other hand, I learned a lot and discovered hundreds of ways to make something work. I find many things to improve on my project regarding the style, but the time spent learning has been very enriching.
